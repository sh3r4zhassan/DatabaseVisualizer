# Database Visualizer

Database Visualizer is a tool that connects to a database, retrieves data, and generates visual representations. It provides two main features:

Data Plotting: Reads values from a database and plots them for easy analysis.
Schema Visualization: Generates a graphical representation of the database schema, helping users understand table relationships.
This project is useful for database administrators, analysts, and developers who need a quick and clear way to explore and visualize their database structures and data trends.
